title: AI Culture Makes Me Want to Ignore It
---

Imagine the internet full of physics enthusiasts posting "physics is the
future of science" and "if you don't learn physics, you'll be left behind"
and "physics will make all jobs obsolete." They think most people will have
a personal nuclear weapon by 2027, and they're "deeply concerned" for the
future but also excited about the possibilities. The Physics companies are
making deals to build a particle collider outside of town which will increase
energy costs but be "good for the economy."

I'd probably think, "ew, physicists are gross, I'm going to think about
something else."

That's kind of where I'm at with AI.

I think if there was a little-known website serving Claude in 2010 that only
a few nerds knew about, I would have had a blast with it. It would have been
so fun. I would have probably made a very detailed Minecraft mod.

LLMs are pretty cool without the cultural context around them. I actually
liked studying "AI" back in college back when my entire experience of it
was the Berkeley online course (CS 188?), research papers and C++/Python.
Now, it's online egotism, tech bro naivete and corporate doublespeak.

I won't argue it's good to completely disregard the context around a thing,
but I find myself wondering if I'd have been better off knowing less.
If a cultural moment had caused me to avoid physics, I don't think that
would have been a good outcome. I guess I might have learned something else
instead then.
