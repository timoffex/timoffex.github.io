Good code, like good writing, comes from writing less.

Before writing a function, take out a notebook and handwrite it, using ellipses
to elide unnecessary details. Then design your functions and classes so that
you don't need ellipses.

Handwriting naturally imposes limits that happen to be great for readability.
Page size is one of the most effective: you want your code to not only be short
vertically, but also horizontally. You'll also not want to write the same thing
over and over. Name it and you have a helper function. Repeated function
arguments? Make them fields of a class.
